My son and I embarked on a memorable adventure to Snowdon, the highest mountain in Wales. Our journey began with a scenic train ride that set the tone for an unforgettable day. Originally, we had planned to take the train up and then walk back down since my son is only eight. However, due to the weather, we encountered a bit of a hiccup. The train staff allowed us to go up but didn't let us disembark at the summit. We paused briefly to take in the stunning views before heading back down by train.

Despite this unexpected change, we were determined to make the most of our day. Once back in Llanberis, we decided to walk up the Llanberis Path anyway. Known for its accessibility and stunning views, the path offered the perfect balance of challenge and beauty for our father-son excursion.

As we started our ascent, the path welcomed us with lush greenery and the soothing sounds of nature. The initial stretch was a gentle incline, allowing us to enjoy the surroundings and savor the fresh mountain air. My son's excitement was contagious, and his energy kept us motivated as we continued our climb.

Considering it was August, the weather was unexpectedly coldâ€”cold enough that we needed gloves. Unfortunately, we only had wool gloves with us, which provided minimal warmth. This turned into a valuable lesson for future hikes: always be prepared for unexpected weather changes, no matter the season.

Midway through our hike, the path became steeper and more rugged. We paused frequently to take in the breathtaking views of the valleys below and the peaks around us. These moments of rest were also perfect for capturing photos and sharing snacks, ensuring we stayed fueled for the journey ahead.

Reaching the summit was an exhilarating experience, even though we had already seen the views from the train. Standing at the top of Snowdon on foot, we were rewarded with a sense of accomplishment and the beauty of the landscape made every step worthwhile. My son's smile at the summit was a highlight of the trip, a testament to the joy of shared adventures.

The descent was equally enjoyable, with the downward journey offering a different perspective of the path we had conquered. As we returned to Llanberis, we reflected on our day's achievements and the bond strengthened by our shared adventure.

Our trip to Snowdon via the Llanberis Path was more than just a hike; it was a day filled with laughter, challenge, and awe-inspiring nature. It's a memory my son and I will cherish forever, and a reminder of the beauty and adventure that awaits in the great outdoors.
